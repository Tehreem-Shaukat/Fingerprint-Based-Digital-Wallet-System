# 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

## "Failed to Fetch" Error - Quick Fix

If you're seeing a **"Failed to fetch"** error when trying to register, follow these steps:

---

## ✅ Step 1: Start the Backend Server

The most common cause is that the backend server is not running.

### Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### Mac/Linux (Terminal):
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

**You should see:**
```
🚀 WebAuthn Fingerprint Authentication Server running on http://localhost:3000
📱 Frontend available at http://localhost:3000
🔐 Using platform authenticator (fingerprint scanner)
```

---

## ✅ Step 2: Verify Server is Running

1. Open a new browser tab
2. Go to: `http://localhost:3000`
3. You should see a JSON response like:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "message": "Fingerprint Wallet API is running"
   }
   ```

If you see this, the server is running correctly!

---

## ✅ Step 3: Check Browser Console

1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Look for any error messages
4. Common errors:
   - `Failed to fetch` → Server not running
   - `CORS error` → CORS configuration issue
   - `Network error` → Connection problem

---

## ✅ Step 4: Verify Port 3000 is Available

If port 3000 is already in use, you'll get an error when starting the server.

### Check if port is in use:
**Windows:**
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
lsof -i :3000
```

### If port is in use:
1. Stop the other application using port 3000, OR
2. Change the port in `backend/server.js`:
   ```javascript
   const PORT = 3001; // Change to different port
   ```
3. Update `frontend/script.js`:
   ```javascript
   const API_BASE = 'http://localhost:3001/api'; // Match the new port
   ```

---

## ✅ Step 5: Check Dependencies

Make sure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

You should see `node_modules` folder created in the `backend` directory.

---

## ✅ Step 6: Verify File Structure

Make sure your project structure looks like this:

```
fingerprint-wallet-html/
├── backend/
│   ├── server.js
│   ├── package.json
│   └── node_modules/ (after npm install)
├── frontend/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── script.js
│   └── style.css
└── README.md
```

---

## ✅ Step 7: Browser Requirements

- **Use localhost or 127.0.0.1** (WebAuthn requires secure context)
- **Modern browser:** Chrome 67+, Edge 18+, Firefox 60+, Safari 13+
- **HTTPS or localhost:** WebAuthn won't work on `http://` except for localhost

---

## ✅ Step 8: Clear Browser Cache

Sometimes cached files can cause issues:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
2. Clear cache and cookies
3. Refresh the page (`Ctrl+F5` or `Cmd+Shift+R`)

## 🔍 Common Error Messages

### "Cannot connect to server"
**Solution:** Start the backend server (see Step 1)

### "CORS policy error"
**Solution:** The server should have CORS enabled. Check `backend/server.js` line 24:
```javascript
app.use(cors()); // Should be present
```

### "WebAuthn is not supported"
**Solution:** 
- Use a modern browser
- Make sure you're on `localhost` or `https://`
- Check if your device has a fingerprint scanner

### "Registration failed"
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for detailed error
- Make sure fingerprint scanner is set up on your device
- Try a different browser

### "Username already exists"
**Solution:** 
- Use a different username, OR
- Delete `backend/users.json` to reset (for testing only)

## 🚀 Quick Test

Run this in your browser console (F12) to test the connection:

```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3000/')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Fingerprint Wallet API is running"
}
```

If this works, the server is running correctly!

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

1. **Check the terminal** where the server is running for error messages
2. **Check browser console** (F12) for detailed errors
3. **Verify all files** are saved correctly
4. **Restart the server** (Ctrl+C to stop, then `npm start` again)
5. **Try a different browser** to rule out browser-specific issues

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

When everything is working correctly, you should:
- ✅ See server running message in terminal
- ✅ No errors in browser console
- ✅ Registration form loads without errors
- ✅ Clicking "Register Fingerprint" shows fingerprint prompt
- ✅ After scanning, see success message

**Most issues are resolved by simply starting the backend server!**
